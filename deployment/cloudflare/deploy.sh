Important Notes for Cloudflare deploy.sh:

This script is tailored for Cloudflare Pages deploying a Next.js application.
Project Name: CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME must match the project name you've created in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
Build Output: It assumes your Next.js build output is in the .next directory (standard for App Router). If you use next export, change .next to out.
wrangler.toml: This script assumes wrangler.toml is configured correctly at the root of your project (or within the $NEXT_APP_DIR if preferred by your setup) to guide Wrangler, especially for bindings (KV, R2, DO, Workers for API).
Database Migrations: prisma db push is commented out with a note. Running migrations directly in a CI/CD script for Cloudflare needs careful consideration of how your database is accessed during the build/deployment. Often, migrations are handled as a separate step or via a dedicated migration service/script that connects to your production/staging database.
Environment Variables: Secrets and environment variables for Cloudflare Pages are best managed through the Cloudflare dashboard or using wrangler pages secret put.
API Backends: If your API routes are part of the Next.js app, they'll be deployed with Pages. If you have separate Cloudflare Workers for your API, you'd deploy them using wrangler deploy with their own wrangler.toml configuration. This script focuses on the Pages deployment.
